## Introduction

The **Project Management System** is a program done in C# using Visual Studio interface. Its primary features are organising tasks, managing teamwork and track the progress of projects. The main object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as *Inheritance*, *Encapsulation*, *Abstraction* and *Polymorphism* are used throughout the program. This system supports various user roles such as Managers, Developers, QA Engineers, and Interns, and they all have their designated responsibilities.

This system is designed to be adaptable and simple to extend, making it well-suited for managing new requirements while maintaining good coding standards.
